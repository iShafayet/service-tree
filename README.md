# ServiceTree

An event-driven, platform agnostic, compact framework for services/provider for the **browser** written in ES6.

## Use case
1. Angular-like [providers/services](https://angular.io/guide/providers) for any framework / no framework.
2. Chainable *ServiceManager*s that can propagate events similar to HTML DOM Nodes.
3. Aggregate events from multiple channel into one (i.e. handle HTTPS and WSS responses from the same ServiceManager handler).
